excerpt: "The Mountian will always take care of you"
---

“The mountain will take care of you.”\
That’s something that my Grandpa told me once\
“If you take care of it”

There’s always been a symbiotic relationship between land and people\
From the Native American’s who preceded us on the land\
To us, who stole this land out of power

We drove out the bears and the wolves\
Insetting ourselves into positions of greater power\
Hunting was now required for the hunter and hunted

Without us, there would be too many\
Too many elk, too many ground squirrels, too many, too many\
We made the ecosystem function

We became as Goddesses\
The mountain would take care of us, if we took care of her

[Do you want to expierence the mountian?](/FEAR)
