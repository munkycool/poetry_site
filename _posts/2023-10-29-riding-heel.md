We could see the storm coming from a long ways off All we had to do was look up the canyon\
Now it was just a waiting game\
The lightning is drawing nearer\
Time to run for cover, time to saddle up, time to hide away The birds wouldn’t duck for cover for awhile yet, we had time

30 minutes

My cousin asked if I wanted to go for a ride\
How could I say no\
They had just gotten a new horse, his name as sleek as he\
Jasper\
He once had pot of gold on his head - team roping, now he lived out his days in peaceful solitude\
Still plenty of life left in him, only 11 years young

I ran to the barn, breath quick in excitement\
Grabbed the lead from the well worn wooden hook\
Grabbed a handful of grain, something I knew Jasper would love\
Anna just grabbed a lead\
We stepped into the coral, the ground damp from a night prior's rain. Unusual.

I walked up to Jasper\
My hand outstretched in reverence, his head lowered, tongue tickling my fingers\
Mutual feelings\
The lead was slipped over his head\
I led him back to the barn, his dark-brown-amost-black coat shimmering in what was left of the sun

25 minutes

I got my saddle from the barn amongst the tens of other saddles that had gathered there in the century since it was built\
No tooling. Clean. Simple. Just how I like it.\
The saddle pad was found, and put on his back\
I hoisted my saddle onto his back\
The shimmering of the leather only matched by the shimmering of his coat\
The bit was slid into his mouth, the reins laid across his back\
I slid onto his back

Anna waited with Blaze\
Another new hand.\
Another pot of gold in a star filled past - team roping.\
Another retirement to the green mountain meadows.

20 minutes

The air was thick with energy\
What was once distant up the canyon now illuminated the sky\
The storm was drawing closer. The horses knew it.\
We rode out of the coral, down the gravel driveway\
The horses help their heads high\
Nervous energy wanting to be let out against the darkening skies\
We trotted for a ways, up to the turn off to the North Field, which we took

15 minutes

We slowed\
A comfortable silence between horse and person\
Only broken by the distant rumble, and the occasional whinny\
We had never seen each other, and yet we felt each other as one Horse and rider

10 minutes

We rode out along the fence\
A trickle that had grown to a fat stream illuminated the silence\
It shall grow fatter upon the rain

Anna turned toward the canyon “Soon”\
We should head back

5 minutes

We rode back\
The saddle came off\
The bit was taken out\
The horses were brushed down\
Handfuls of grain and scratches were given as rewards

0 minutes

We scatter. Some enjoy safety, others rain.
