This is the first entry on my new blog! I can't belive that I'm starting this up again.
In the past I've been really bad about starting something and then not finishing it.
I have a feeling that this time will be different. That this time I'm going to actually
show my thoughts and feelings to the world.

This year I decided to take a gap year, and what a year it's been.

Is it depression or boerdom?

I want to know, but I don't, I can't get into my head. But poetry expands it.
