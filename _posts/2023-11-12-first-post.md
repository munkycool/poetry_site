Dear Reader,

I can't belive that I've never started a blog before. Well, I have, but with all those I got burned out after a few days or weeks or maybe, if I was lucky, months. But this time shit's going to be different. This time I'm motivated. And I can't wait to have you along with me on this journey.

To be honest there's been blood, sweat, and many tears (and no blood) to get to the end, but I hope that ya'll 'll enjoy.

I can't wait to see what I'll write next. And where that will take me.

With love, dearest reader,\
ulysses
