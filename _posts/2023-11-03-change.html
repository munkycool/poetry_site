        Running<br>
        Sprinting around the pines and aspens<br> 
        Sprinting over knee-high sagebrush<br>
        They can’t get away<br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        I stop,<br>
        I catch<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A whiff of death upon the air<br>
        Searching through the aspens<br> 
        Elk, A different kind of cow<br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Gramps pulled<br> 
        Ivories<br> 
        Added to hundreds<br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        I cannot stop<br>
        I must chase after the living<br>
        The cows can’t get on the meadow<br>
        The thick grass still yet to be cut, dried, baled<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m on the 4-wheeler<br>
        My aunt and uncle<br>
        (great)<br>
        Close behind<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        They scurry through a break in the fence<br> 
        It’s too dense for a 4-wheeler<br>
        Walking it is<br>
        We all get off, and walk after them<br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        We walk,<br>
        We run,<br>
        They walk,<br> 
        They run<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        We start to gain<br>
        Cornered<br>
        They look at us<br>
        They continue<br> 
    </p>
        I run after them, leaving my aunt and uncle at the foot. Faster and faster I run. Yet they’re always one step ahead of me. As skilled as mountain goats, they run straight up the mountain. Even the old bull that was with them was seemingly as spy as a cat. And yet I continue on. Up the mountain I run, so too do they. On and on, up and up. Until they’re gone. Over the mountain, uncatchable. I turn and look. The beauty of the land stretched out before me. Up in the mountains, alone. Surrounded by beauty, and yet, I felt empty inside. Just as the land had changed. I knew that I too must. And yet I didn’t, couldn’t bring myself to do so. I looked to the heavens, shouting why? Why? WHY?

        Ivory<br>
        Gone<br>
        Empty<br>
