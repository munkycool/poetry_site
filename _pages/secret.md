Hello there. I see that you've discovered this page. Well, not that I make it hard. I wanted you here. In fact, I needed you here. There's more to this website than meets the [eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googly_eyes). There's so much more. So please, explore. As a reward for finding this page, and hopefully as an incentive to explore furthur, visit [/photos/](/photos/) to see some of the photos that I found related to this project!

Also, while the posts are meant to be read in chronological order, it doesn't really matter what order they are read in.

I hope that you have been enjoying reading my thoughts. I also hope that you've ready for whatever your future on this website holds. My hope is that it's something that sticks with you, dear reader.

If you need help please reach out to someone. Whether that be a professional, or a freind or a family member. You're worth it. You're not alone. And it's going to get better.

If you need immediate help, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 988. They saved my life once, I'm sure they can do the same for you.

With love,\
Artemis Ulysses Tack
