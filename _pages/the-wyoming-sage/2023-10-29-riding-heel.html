        We could see the storm coming from a long ways off All we had to do was look up the canyon<br>
        Now it was just a waiting game<br>
        The lightning is drawing nearer<br>
        Time to run for cover, time to saddle up, time to hide away The birds wouldn't duck for cover for awhile yet, we had time<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        30 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        My cousin asked if I wanted to go for a ride<br>
        How could I say no<br>
        They had just gotten a new horse, his name as sleek as he<br>
        Jasper<br>
        He once had pot of gold on his head - team roping, now he lived out his days in peaceful solitude<br>
        Still plenty of life left in him, only 11 years young<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I ran to the barn, breath quick in excitement<br>
        Grabbed the lead from the well worn wooden hook<br>
        Grabbed a handful of grain, something I knew Jasper would love<br>
        Anna just grabbed a lead<br>
        We stepped into the coral, the ground damp from a night prior's rain. Unusual.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I walked up to Jasper<br>
        My hand outstretched in reverence, his head lowered, tongue tickling my fingers<br>
        Mutual feelings<br>
        The lead was slipped over his head<br>
        I led him back to the barn, his dark-brown-amost-black coat shimmering in what was left of the sun<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        25 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I got my saddle from the barn amongst the tens of other saddles that had gathered there in the century since it was built<br>
        No tooling. Clean. Simple. Just how I like it.<br>
        The saddle pad was found, and put on his back<br>
        I hoisted my saddle onto his back<br>
        The shimmering of the leather only matched by the shimmering of his coat<br>
        The bit was slid into his mouth, the reins laid across his back<br>
        I slid onto his back<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Anna waited with Blaze<br>
        Another new hand.<br>
        Another pot of gold in a star filled past - team roping.<br>
        Another retirement to the green mountain meadows.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        20 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The air was thick with energy<br>
        What was once distant up the canyon now illuminated the sky<br>
        The storm was drawing closer. The horses knew it.<br>
        We rode out of the coral, down the gravel driveway<br>
        The horses help their heads high<br>
        Nervous energy wanting to be let out against the darkening skies<br>
        We trotted for a ways, up to the turn off to the North Field, which we took<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        15 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        We slowed<br>
        A comfortable silence between horse and person<br>
        Only broken by the distant rumble, and the occasional whinny<br>
        We had never seen each other, and yet we felt each other as one Horse and rider<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        10 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        We rode out along the fence<br>
        A trickle that had grown to a fat stream illuminated the silence<br>
        It shall grow fatter upon the rain<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Anna turned toward the canyon “Soon”<br>
        We should head back<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        5 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        We rode back<br>
        The saddle came off<br>
        The bit was taken out<br>
        The horses were brushed down<br>
        Handfuls of grain and scratches were given as rewards<br>
    </p>
    <p class="time">
        0 minutes<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        We scatter. Some enjoy safety, others rain.<br>
