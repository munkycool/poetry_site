        Hey girl, just wanted to call and say that I know change is hard. Man, trust me I know. But you know what, so is staying the same. 
        In fact, ain't it even more scary? Look man, I love you, and I'm here for you, and I care 'bout you. And you can't keep living like this man. 
        Someday you're going to snap, and that black bitch's gonna get ya.

            Just as the air cools, so too does it warm<br>
            Waking from her slumber was the Mountain <br>
            Groundsquirels starred for curious onlookers<br>
            Mountain prairie turning to green<br>
            Meadowlarks were singing from their barbed wire perches <br>
            The Mountain's changing<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            A month prior the wind was biting<br>
            Now, as we arrive, it's cool<br>
            Still snowbanks yet to thaw,<br>
            But no longer thick white blankets adorn the ground Winter has lost her cold grasp on the land<br>
            The season's changing<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            We got there as the birds were beginning their chirping <br>
            Silent bliss of it all<br>
            Trees laughing as the wind tickled their leaves<br>
            Purple hues of Lupin shimmering with the wind<br>
            Far off, the rush of a creek that had grown fat with snow <br>
            The land's changing<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            It had been a year since we were last out there<br>
            My hair bounced when I walked now<br>
            My ass jiggled more<br>
            The ropes of school had snapped, and the chains of gap-year-bordem had set in <br>
            More people knew Me<br>
            The fuck? Even I was changing<br>
